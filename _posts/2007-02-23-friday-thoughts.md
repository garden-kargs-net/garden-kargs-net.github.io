Anna had a full day of girl scout workshops today. That left me and the boys here. We mostly rested, but did venture out to the library to return some things. The boys also got a haircut today. We went to fish fry tonight at church. It was yummy. We saw many good friends.

I was thinking today about how little patience I have sometimes with my children. While reading another blog, I saw how another mom deals with that. It inspired me to do better. My children are blessings, I need to always remember that.
