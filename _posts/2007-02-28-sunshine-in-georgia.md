Today was a beautiful day in Georgia.
The temperature was pleasant in the 70s.
The kids and I went to the park today.
We also planted some yellow and purple violas
in the flower box on the front porch.
We cleaned out one of our Mary gardens in the backyard.
St. Francis is still watching over all the plants.

The kids played on the trampoline.
Christopher joined right in with them.
He still does not like to wear shoes or pants.
So, he was in shirt and diaper.
Oh well, it was warm plenty for him.

We filled the bird feeders with sunflower seeds.
The birds will be happy!

The weather is supposed to be rainy tomorrow,
so we will stay in and do some inside things.
Until the next spring day.
