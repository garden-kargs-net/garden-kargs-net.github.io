Well, today is my 40th birthday.  I'm not sure what to think.  I guess
I'm just 40.  So what, I am still young.  Josh lost his last baby
tooth tonight.  He acts pretty sad about it.  One more tooth fairy
visit for him tonight.  I can't remember losing my last tooth or my
first for that matter.  But, I'm sure it was a big thing back then
too.  We had a nice dinner out, just Steve and me.  We went to a
Japanese steakhouse and had the Hibachi dinner.  Steve baked a cake for
me, and decorated it.  Wow, I am blessed with such wonderful people in
my life.  Thanks God, you are good to me!

    Happy 40th Birthday, my love! I had a wonderful time at dinner, and
    also enjoyed taking the kids present shopping for you. They are a
    handful -- I wonder how you do it all day long!
    Love,

    Steve
