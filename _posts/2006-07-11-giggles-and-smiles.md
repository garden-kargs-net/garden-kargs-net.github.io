Today Christopher woke up before Josh and Anna.  He came downstairs by himself. He decided that he wanted a drink and snuggle in Mommyâ€™s arms.

He snuggled for awhile, then went on his way, to get into some things, his favorite thing to do these days. His smile is very bright and warm.

Josh got up and gave Chris some piggy back rides around the living room. He giggled and smiled the entire time.  They are like two peas in a pod.
