My kids are having a difficult time with the prospect of moving.
My friend at church told me it would be OK and that they would bounce back.
I know it affects them, though.
Anna is affected in a different way than Joshua, she asks me often when the
moving truck will come, when we will start packing.
She also says, “I will miss Angel.”
Angel is one of her best friends, who lives next door.
I need to find the right words to say to my kids,
but I don’t know what those are, at the moment.
I know God will lead us in the right directions and give me those words to say.

Angel came over to play last evening with Anna.
Anna was very happy to play Polly Pockets with her.
That made me smile.
