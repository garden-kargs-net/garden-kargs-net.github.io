Today, Joshua returned from the long weekend scouting adventure. He went with his peers and some leaders to Pensacola, FL. They visited the naval museum and the USS Alabama. He had a great time! Weâ€™re happy to have him home!

Anna had her best friend, Abby over to play today. They jumped on the trampoline for what seemed like forever. It was great to hear their little giggles of delight as they enjoyed themselves immensely. Christopher was on the trampoline too. He held onto the side and jumped along with them. He too giggled and smiled alot today. Anna and Abby played dress up and dressed like pirates and princesses. Thanks God for wonderful friends!

We are all pencils in the hand of God.
