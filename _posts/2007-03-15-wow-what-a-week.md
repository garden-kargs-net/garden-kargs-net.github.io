We have all been sick this week, except my wonderful husband. I pray he will stay well. Joshua was sick last week, I got sick on Fridat and was in bed for 5 days. We had the flu. The two younger ones are sick now, but getting better.

We are trying to get back in the swing of things now. Today we worked on schoolwork. Anna is working on money in math. Chris loves to do puzzles. Joshua is reviewing multiplication and fractions in math. We started a new chapter on China this week.

We had someone come unexpectedly to look at the house today. What a job to keep it ready to show at all times. It is impossible!!!
