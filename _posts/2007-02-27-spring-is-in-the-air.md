It was a beautiful day today, sunshine and in the 70s. The kids played outside with neighborhood children. Joshua worked on his treehouse. Anna and Christopher jumped on the trampoline. The daffodils are blooming. The other flowers are peeking out, loving the warm air and sunshine, I am sure.

Our Lenten flowers are very welcoming on the front door. I love gardening and can’t wait to get started. The warm temperatures are beckoning me outside. We read about self-sacrifice and Lent today. We also worked on math, grammar, and spelling. Joshua worked on history. The kids gathered some materials outside for the Easter Garden Centerpiece that we are going to build. I got the idea from “A Year with God”.

Tomorrow is supposed to be sunny and warm like today. We saw many birds in the backyard today. They are happy that the bird feeders are full. They sing in the morning as we awaken. Their songs sound so joyful and happy. I was reading about “joy” yesterday in my devotional. I was reminded that one can be happy without being joyful. Being happy over something can be fleeting. Joy is deeper and reaches down into the soul. Being joyful in all things takes practice. Something to think about…
