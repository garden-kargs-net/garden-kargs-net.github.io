This week has gone by quickly. Yesterday we went to the park for a while, had lunch with Steve and had arts and crafts day for school. The kids did some finger painting, Play-doh, and made some Lenten crafts on the deck. Joshua is sick today. He has a sore throat and fever. We will visit the pediatrician this afternoon. We will relax today and watch movies. As I am sitting downstairs, it sounds like a herd of elephants upstairs. Could it be? Anna and Christopher most likely playing Marbleworks in my bedroom. Hmm. I didn’t know you had to jump while playing Marbleworks. I better go and check!

*"To smile at someone who is sad; to visit, even for a little while, someone who is lonely; to give someone shelter from the rain with our umbrella; to read something for someone who is blind; these and others can be small things, very small things, but they are appropriate to give our love of God concrete expression to the poor." – Mother Teresa of Calcutta*
