Today we are working on flashcards, worksheets, and reading. We are also getting ready for our trip with Steve to Dallas. It will give the kids a chance to see the area. So, we do laundry, pack, make lists…

Christopher is in a mood today. He didn’t want his diaper changed this morning. He is trying to be independent, I know. I chased him and he ran. All the while with the droopy diaper, drooping. What a site. I guess you just had to be here.

We have a stray cat that just came to us this past weekend. Anna named her “Buttercup”. She is beautiful with yellow spots. Her coat is white with creamy yellow spots and yellow ringed tail. She is rather friendly, so I wonder if she has an owner, but she has been here for three days now. Our cat, Rebel, had a confrontation with her this morning. No fighting though. I think Rebel is too old to fight or care for that matter.

I was reading my devotional this morning and came across this quote from Mother Teresa, “Life is a promise, fulfull it.”

God gives us life each day. It is up to us to make it all it can be.
