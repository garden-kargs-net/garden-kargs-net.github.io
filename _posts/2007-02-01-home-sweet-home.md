We arrived back home last night from Dallas Ft. Worth area. It was a long trip. The kids did fine for the first 8 hours on the road. Then, it got a little rocky. We made it though, safe and sound. We did some sightseeing while Steve went to work every day. The kids had a good time.

What do I think of Dallas, well it was sunny, (a plus), windy this time of year. Not bad. I’m still trying to decide, what do I think???

But, then again, does it really matter? God will lead us where he sees fit.

Today we unpacked, did laundry and worked on math. The kids are really glad to see their home again.

There’s no place like home, especially if you have the people that matter around you!

Something to think about:

## Mother Teresa’s prayer...

*People are often unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered;*

**Forgive them anyway.**

*If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives;*

**Be kind anyway.**

*If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies;*

**Succeed anyway.**

*If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you;*

**Be honest and frank anyway.**

*What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight;*

**Build anyway.**

*If you find serenity and happiness, there may be jealousy;*

**Be happy anyway.**

*The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow;*

**Do good anyway.**

*Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;*

**Give the world the best you’ve got anyway.**

*You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and God;*

**It was never between you and them anyway.**

~~prayer on the walls of Mother Teresa’s convents*
