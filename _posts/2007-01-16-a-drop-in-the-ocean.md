We are reading aloud “Polar Bear, Polar Bear, what do you hear?” Each day is a different animal that we then study about. We do a coloring page on that animal too! I got the idea from the website, [DLTK’s Crafts for Kids](http://www.dltk-teach.com/books/brownbear/sequel.htm). The kids love coloring the pictures, which are big and simple. They also like learning facts about each animal!

Each day is a blessing and the kids learn something new. Without the effort, something is missed. The moments we have now never happen again. We make the most of our time together.

*“We ourselves feel that what we are doing is just a drop in the ocean. But the ocean would be less because of that missing drop.” ~Mother Teresa*

Thanks for the Mother Teresa quote! I needed to read that today.
