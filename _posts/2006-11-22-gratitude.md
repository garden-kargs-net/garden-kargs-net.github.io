Tomorrow is Thanksgiving. I think I’m ready. The food is mostly prepared. We are having Steve’s brother, Lou over to have dinner with us and stay for a few days. We are in the middle of relocating to another state and another job. It is stressful, but all the while we are thankful for a new opportunity and the job we still have.

The kids are ill today, at least two of them. Anna has the flu, Christopher has croup. But, they are running around now chasing one another. As I am writing this, Christopher, who is 2 1/2, came over to me, looked at me and slowly pulled the tabs of his diaper, dropped it and ran. Obviously wanting me to chase him. He is almost ready for potty training, I think. One more milestone. He isn’t so little anymore. Gratitude… we can find it in every moment, if we only look. Even, in the naked babies running around the house.

“Gratitude. More aware of what you have than what you don’t. Recognizing the treasure in the simple-a child’s hug, fertile soil, a golden sunset. Relishing in the comfort of the common-a warm bed, a hot meal, a clean shirt.” ~Max Lucado
