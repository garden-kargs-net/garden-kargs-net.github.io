Just to watch my children each day as they discover new things about themselves and each other is a wonderful experience for me. When mommy is having a difficult day, I watch them as they help one another out and me as well.  I hope they continue to be as loving and giving to one another and others as they grow up.

We went to homeschool 4-H today.  They learned about erosion and specifically beach erosion and the ocean.  There was a model set up with sand and plants. They took turns using a fan to mist and blow on the sand to learn what effect wind has on the beaches.

My children are such a gift.  How could I ask for anything more...
