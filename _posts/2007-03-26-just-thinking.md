I was just thinking today about grace. When I think of grace, it reminds me of how thankful I am to have all the things that I don’t really deserve. God surrounds me with grace each day. I am reminded of it when I look at my family, especially my children. They soak up everything that I teach them, hopefully mostly good, but I’m not perfect, none of us are. My hope is that they see gratitude in me and will have it as well. Amazing grace how sweet the sound. I grew up singing that song in church, never really stopping to think about what it really means to me. It is for me the sweet sounds of my children’s voices, their laughter fills our home with angelic presence. I pray for the patience to be to them what they need and deserve. Our lives are so busy, we need to slow down and savor each moment. They are not here always.

We had a good day today. We were busy. Tomorrow we will slow down, read some books, and play.

Grace is defined in this [article](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06689a.htm) as:

” a supernatural help of God for salutary acts granted in consideration of the merits of Christ.”

I know that I need daily that supernatural help. Thank you, God.
