Today is the first day of Spring. It is a beautiful day, expected temperatures in the 70s. The birds are singing, the sun is shining. The kids are fighting….wait, not that. But, as I am writing this, Christopher is aggravating Anna. She is screaming. Not the peaceful scene that I had moments ago pictured. Having kids at home is highly unpredictable as to what might happen next. Anyway, as I was saying the day is a beautiful one. The flowers are waking up to the bright sunshine. The sky is a nice shade of blue. We finished schoolwork for today, so the day is free to explore the outdoors and play.

We collected rocks yesterday for our rock study. There aren’t that many different kinds of rocks in our backyard, so we just sorted them by shape and size.

I really love Spring and all of the beautiful things that it brings…like the pansy parade I saw today!
