We had a wonderful 12th birthday party for Joshua yesterday. The weather was cool, but nice and sunny. The kids had a great time together. We rented a bouncy house to entertain the kids. We also have the trampoline in the backyard that kept everyone busy. We had four scout friends here. We also had my mom, sister, and niece and nephew. We had friends from church. A great time was had by all!

Today we worked on school. Anna is learning the months of the year with flowers to go along with it. I found this online at this [site](http://www.first-school.ws/theme/printables/month-birth-flowers.htm).

We are learning January first. Carnation is the flower. We learned the origin of the carnation, what colors they come in, and the symbolism of the flower. She also worked on math, handwriting, and spelling today.

Joshua is learning about Europe and the Renaissance. We use the [Catholic Heritage Curricula](http://www.chcweb.com/catalog/ByGradeLevel/SixthGrade/AllYeLandsWorldCulturesandGeography/product_info.html?s=b9fd895c303c55b02b310566e005b393) History book for this class. We like the way it incorporates our Catholic values in each lesson. Joshua also worked on spelling, handwriting, and art.

We played outside and enjoyed the sunshine today. I relaxed in the backyard swing while the kids played. The sunshine felt warm and comforting on my face. I enjoyed the birds at the feeders today. I saw the mourning doves for the first time today. They were sharing with the gray squirrel.

Thought for today:

“Every moment is full of wonder and God is always present.” from [365 Day Brighteners](http://www.amazon.com/365-Brighteners-Celebrating-Gods-Grace/dp/1580617352/ref=sr_1_2/002-7362340-6035208?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1173140720&sr=8-2)

“Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.” Psalm 73:23 NIV
