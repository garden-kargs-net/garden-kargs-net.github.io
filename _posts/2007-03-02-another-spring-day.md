Yesterday was rainy and stormy.
Today the birds are singing, the sun is shining once again. We are thankful.

Joshua did some testing this morning and did very well!
All of our work paid off.
Anna worked on the basics, math and handwriting today.
Now she is helping Christopher build a tall tower of Marble-works in my bedroom.
I just heard a thump.
A chair toppled over, but in all the chaos, my long-lost earring was found.
It had gotten stuck in the chair somehow. Hidden blessings, I am sure!

Joshua is working on his train layout.
He is really interested in trains once again.
He has a board with wheels that he will store underneath his bed when not in use.
Joshua is planning the layout of the tracks and scenery.

We will spend the rest of the day tidying the house, playing,
and planning Joshua’s 12th birthday party which is on Sunday.
I will make the cake, so I found the recipe this morning.
He doesn’t want a theme, just a plain birthday cake with candles.
He has friends coming over to play on the trampoline and in the bouncy house on Sunday.
I can’t believe that he will be 12 already. Time sure does fly!

Blessings!
Until next time.
