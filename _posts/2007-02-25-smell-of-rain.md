We woke up this morning to the sound of rain.
I looked out and sure enough the streets were wet.
I know we need the rain, so I won’t complain.
We went to Mass and out to lunch.
Anna and I went to a friend’s baby shower in the afternoon.
It had stopped raining after lunch.

My kids say that it rains because the plants and trees are thirsty.
God is providing them with refreshment and nourishment.
Kids are so insightful.
Just to listen to them says to me that God is speaking through them to me.
Since God is all powerful, it is likely that He uses us all in many ways.

What does rain smell like?
Just my thoughts, refreshing, clean, and definitely wet for sure.
But, whatever it is like, I am thankful!
