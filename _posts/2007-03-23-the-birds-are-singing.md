Today was a beautiful day in Georgia! The birds were singing. They sounded very happy that Spring has arrived. The pollen count today was very high. I can feel it in my throat.
Just a by product of our beautiful trees and flowers.

We went on a field trip today. Just on a whim…not planned. The kids had spring fever and needed to get out. We visited a nature center and learned a lot about the animals there. The turtles seemed to be a favorite. We had a picnic lunch before going on the trails.

We smelled some sweet tea olives. Tea olives are very fragrant. I had to ask the caretaker what smelled so sweet? He told us what the plant was called. We will have to look for one for our home.

We learned that the turtles like to bask in the sun, but are easily spooked. They were lined up on a log in the water. The kids really enjoyed watching them. As we were leaving we saw a sign that had a turtle crossing!

Fish Friday. We had tilapia, also known as St. Peter’s fish for dinner on a green salad. It was yummy! The weekend is supposed to be very nice. It is nice to be warm!
