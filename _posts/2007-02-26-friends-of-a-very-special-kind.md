Today, Christopher and I went for his speech therapy appointment. He is having some problems with pronunciation of his words. He is definitely improving. We have some tools to help him at home. His siblings are both ready to help too. Anna, still in her nightgown, along with a dress-up shirt and dress-up shoes is all ready to be his “teacher” this morning. She just got frustrated with him though and said to him, “Here is your paper, Christopher, now practice your cutting skills, if you may.” Out of the mouths of babes, we always say. She is his little “teacher” today.

We worked on some crafts today. We are making some Lenten crafts to display with our Lenten altar. The kids painted some wooden letters which will spell “Alleluia”. We will bring them out at Easter. I got the idea from another [mom](http://dawnathome.typepad.com/), Dawn, who shared the idea on her [site](http://dawnathome.typepad.com/by_sun_and_candlelight/2007/02/ash_wednesday_1.html). We plan to put some glitter on them when they dry. The kids worked well together and learned a lot, I hope!

I am remembering the sunrise on Friday morning. I saw this through the window of Joshua’s room.

Later today, we plan to meet a very special friend of mine. A lady from our parish has offered to make a first communion dress for Anna. This dear lady was my prayer partner when Anna was born, so we have always been close to her. She has said for years that she wants to make Anna’s dress, when the time comes. So, even though she won’t make first communion until next year, we will start on the dress now. We will go today to pick out a pattern and fabric. My dear friend is fighting bladder cancer and is elderly. So, I pray that she will be healed. She is a wonderful inspiration to us all. Oh, she also makes the best homemade jams! Yum!!
