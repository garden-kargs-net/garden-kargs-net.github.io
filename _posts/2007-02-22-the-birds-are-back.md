Yesterday I mentioned that I wish the birds would return. I was awakened this morning with the beautiful song of a bird that I didn’t recognize. I guess the bird seed helped. I saw many at the feeder throughout the day. It is nice to hear their song again.

The weather was so wonderful today with temps in the 70’s. The kids had their friends over today to play. They played in the backyard, jumped on the trampoline and worked on the treehouse. They also played with playdough on the back porch. Our friends brought the bunny over to visit. We gave them the bunny several months ago because of our move. The bunny is more tame now and is getting so big. Her new name is “Hazel”. We also had a hermit crab and hamster in our midst. We called it our “Noah’s Ark” on the back deck. The animals and the children had a great time together.
