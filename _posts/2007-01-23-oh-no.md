Yesterday we were having craft time and doing some scissor practice. I left the room for a few minutes. When I returned, I discovered that Anna experimented with cutting her hair. Her hair was getting so long and pretty. She made a pretty good gap in the side, without a mirror! I tried to keep my cool about the whole thing, but I have to admit it was difficult seeing that. We went to the salon later in the evening and had her hair cut. It is really short now. But, she seems to like it a lot. It does look really cute on her. You just never know where the scissors might go!
