Wife to my dear husband, Steve. We are a Catholic homeschooling family of 5, plus 3 cats. Forever my angel in heaven's mom, Mary Elizabeth, 9-3-98~9-4-98. 

I am so thankful to be on this journey with my husband and children! We are protected and always surrounded by His wonderful grace! Thank you, Lord! I am forever grateful for this opportunity to spend with my children. Thank you to my husband for being my partner in this journey!
